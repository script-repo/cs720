# AI Chat Integration - Always Available

## Changes Made

The AI chat panel is now **always visible and functional**, regardless of whether an account is selected.

### What Changed

**File: `frontend/src/components/layout/AIPanel.tsx`**

1. **Removed account requirement** - The chat panel no longer shows "Select an account to start chatting"
2. **Dynamic context** - Shows different prompts based on whether an account is selected
3. **Account-agnostic queries** - Uses `'general'` as account ID when no account is selected

### Behavior

#### Without Account Selected
- **Header:** "AI Assistant - Ask me anything"
- **Welcome message:** "Ask me anything or select an account for context-aware answers"
- **Sample prompts:**
  - "What can you help me with?"
  - "Explain the CS720 platform"
  - "How does data sync work?"
- **Account ID:** `'general'` (for storing chat history)

#### With Account Selected
- **Header:** "AI Assistant - Ask questions about [Account Name]"
- **Welcome message:** "Ask me anything about [Account Name]"
- **Sample prompts:**
  - "What are the top priorities?"
  - "What projects are in progress?"
  - "Any upcoming renewals?"
- **Account ID:** Actual account ID with context

### API Integration

The chat communicates with the AI Service through the backend API:

```
Frontend AIPanel
    ‚Üì
POST /api/ai/query
    ‚Üì
Backend API (3001)
    ‚Üì
AI Service (3003)
    ‚Üì
Ollama (11434) or OpenAI (via Proxy)
```

**Request format:**
```json
{
  "accountId": "acc_123" or "general",
  "query": "What are the priorities?"
}
```

The backend will:
1. Load account context if `accountId` is not "general"
2. Build appropriate system prompt
3. Send to AI Service
4. Return response to frontend

### Chat History

Chat history is stored separately for each context:
- **General chat:** Stored with accountId = `'general'`
- **Account-specific chat:** Stored with actual account ID

When switching between accounts, the appropriate chat history is loaded.

### User Experience

1. **Page loads** ‚Üí AI chat panel is visible on the right side
2. **User can immediately** ‚Üí Start asking general questions
3. **User selects account** ‚Üí Chat context switches to account-specific
4. **Previous general chat** ‚Üí Preserved and can be accessed again by deselecting account

### Testing

To test the AI chat:

1. **Without account:**
   ```
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - See AI panel on right side
   - Type: "What can you help me with?"
   - AI responds with general information
   ```

2. **With account:**
   ```
   - Select an account from the list
   - AI panel updates to show account context
   - Type: "What are the top priorities?"
   - AI responds with account-specific information
   ```

### Backend Requirements

The backend `/api/ai/query` endpoint should handle:

1. **General queries** (accountId = "general"):
   - No account context loaded
   - Respond with platform information, general help
   - Use default system prompt

2. **Account-specific queries** (accountId = actual ID):
   - Load account data (documents, priorities, projects, etc.)
   - Include account context in system prompt
   - Provide context-aware responses

### Example Backend Logic

```typescript
if (accountId === 'general') {
  // No account context
  systemPrompt = "You are an AI assistant for CS720, a customer intelligence platform..."
  context = null
} else {
  // Load account context
  const account = await getAccount(accountId)
  const documents = await getDocuments(accountId)
  const priorities = await getPriorities(accountId)

  systemPrompt = `You are an AI assistant for CS720. You're helping with account: ${account.name}...`
  context = { account, documents, priorities, ... }
}
```

### Benefits

‚úÖ **Immediate availability** - Users can start chatting right away
‚úÖ **Contextual awareness** - Automatically adapts based on selected account
‚úÖ **Preserved history** - Separate chat histories for general and each account
‚úÖ **Smooth transitions** - Seamlessly switches context when account changes
‚úÖ **Better UX** - No confusing "select account" messages

### Next Steps

To fully enable this feature:

1. ‚úÖ Frontend updated to show AI panel always
2. ‚è≥ Backend needs to handle "general" accountId
3. ‚è≥ Update backend to provide appropriate responses for general queries
4. ‚è≥ Test with both general and account-specific queries
