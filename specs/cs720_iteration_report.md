---

## Alignment Assessment

### 1. Problem → Product Charter ✅ **Strongly Aligned (95%)**

**Problem (Callie Quest):**
- SEs lose critical customer context during account transitions
- Information scattered across Salesforce, OneDrive, emails
- Manual handoffs take hours, risk losing institutional knowledge
- Scale challenge: 400-500 enterprise sites per SE

**Charter Response (Mara Focus):**
- ✅ **Feature 1 (Customer Profile Dashboard):** Directly addresses "scattered information" → Aggregated view
- ✅ **Feature 2 (Natural Language Query):** Solves "hours to minutes" → Instant answers
- ✅ **Feature 3 (Business Intelligence Integration):** Adds strategic context → Beyond internal data

**Alignment Score:** 95%
- MVP features directly address all core pain points
- <5 min goal aligns perfectly with "hours → minutes" objective
- Local-first architecture ensures data security (implicit requirement)

**Gap Found:**
- ⚠️ **Deployment topology visibility** mentioned in problem (400-500 sites) but deferred to v2. This is acceptable for MVP, but should be explicitly tracked.

---

  - Stage 3-4: Dashboard scan (Feature 1)
  - Stage 5-6: AI queries (Feature 2)
  - Stage 7: Industry context (Feature 3)
- ✅ **Flow B (Pre-Meeting Prep):** Uses all 3 features with delta focus

**Alignment Score:** 100%
- Both flows exercise all MVP features
- Emotional journey (Overwhelmed → Confident) maps to success metric (<5 min)
- Edge cases documented for each feature

**Strength:**
- Dual flow approach covers both initial onboarding AND ongoing value
- Delta indicators in Flow B show product thinking beyond first-use

---

### 3. Flows → Wireframes ✅ **Strongly Aligned (98%)**

**Flow Requirements:**
- Dashboard with 6 contextual cards
- AI chat panel for queries
- Modal drill-downs for details
- Delta indicators for returning users

**Wireframe Delivery (Naya Wire):**
- ✅ **Screen 1 (Main Dashboard):** Maps exactly to Flow A & B
  - 6 cards present (Key Priorities, Upcoming Dates, Projects, Issues, Tickets, BI)
  - AI panel right side (persistent)
  - Modal pattern for details (click → overlay)
- ✅ **Delta UI:** "Last viewed X days ago" badge (Flow B requirement)
- ✅ **Empty/Loading/Error states:** All documented

**Alignment Score:** 98%

**Minor Gap:**
- ⚠️ **"New" badges on cards** mentioned in Flow B, but wireframe specs don't detail the visual indicator style. Should specify: color (purple?), position (top-right?), animation (pulse?).

---

### 4. Wireframes → Design System ✅ **Strongly Aligned (100%)**

**Wireframe Components Required:**
- Cards, Badges, Buttons, Inputs, Modals, Sidebar, Chat Messages
- Dark theme with purple gradient
- Accessibility requirements

**Design System Delivery (Aria Patterns):**
- ✅ **All 12 components specified:** Matches wireframe needs exactly
- ✅ **Tokens defined:** Deep purple-blue gradient (#7C3AED → #6366F1)
- ✅ **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance, keyboard nav, screen reader support
- ✅ **Motion:** Reduced motion support, appropriate durations (150/300/500ms)

**Alignment Score:** 100%
- Every wireframe element has a corresponding design system component
- Dark theme + purple gradient consistently applied
- Component states (hover, focus, disabled) match interaction patterns

**Strength:**
- Design system goes beyond wireframes with a11y contracts (proactive)
- Token-based system enables easy theming (future light mode?)

---

### 5. Design System → Frontend Architecture ✅ **Strongly Aligned (95%)**

**Design System Outputs:**
- 12 components with props/states
- Tokens (colors, typography, spacing, motion)
- Accessibility contracts

**Frontend Architecture (Cyrus Stack):**
- ✅ **Component tree matches design system:** Button, Card, Badge, Input, Modal, etc.
- ✅ **TypeScript interfaces align:** Props defined for all components
- ✅ **PWA architecture:** Supports offline (design system works without server)
- ✅ **IndexedDB storage:** All 12 components can render from local data

**Alignment Score:** 95%

**Gap Found:**
- ⚠️ **Chat Message component streaming:** Design system specs "streaming text" for AI responses, but frontend architecture doesn't detail the WebSocket or SSE implementation. Should clarify: polling vs. WebSocket for real-time updates.

---

### 6. Frontend → Backend ✅ **Strongly Aligned (92%)**

**Frontend Requirements:**
- OAuth with Salesforce/OneDrive
- Daily sync orchestration
- Document transformation (markdown)
- LLM query with fallback
- IndexedDB data model alignment

**Backend Delivery (Eko Logic):**
- ✅ **15 API endpoints:** Cover all frontend needs
- ✅ **OAuth flows:** Salesforce + OneDrive with token encryption
- ✅ **Sync orchestrator:** Daily cron + manual trigger
- ✅ **Document pipeline:** DOCX/PDF → Markdown (in-memory)
- ✅ **LLM proxy:** External (OpenAI) → Local (Ollama) fallback

**Alignment Score:** 92%

**Gaps Found:**
1. ⚠️ **Account subset selection logic:** Frontend spec says "subset of accounts synced initially" but backend doesn't define which accounts (all? user-selected? top 25?). **Need product decision.**
2. ⚠️ **Sync progress updates:** Frontend expects real-time progress (Zustand store updates), but backend spec doesn't specify mechanism (WebSocket? Polling? Server-Sent Events?). **Need technical decision.**

**Strength:**
- Local-first architecture (both frontend/backend on laptop) ensures data security
- Type alignment is excellent (Account, Document, Project interfaces match exactly)

---

### 7. Backend → QA ✅ **Strongly Aligned (98%)**

**Backend Endpoints & Features:**
- Auth, Sync, Data retrieval, AI query, BI
- Error handling (auth-failed, quota-exceeded, network-error, parse-error)

**QA Coverage (Kyra Gauge):**
- ✅ **Happy paths:** Account Transition (10 steps), Pre-Meeting Prep (8 steps), Sync (8 steps)
- ✅ **Edge cases:** No documents, corrupted files, LLM timeout, expired tokens, large volume
- ✅ **Negative tests:** Invalid queries, network interruption, quota exceeded, stale data
- ✅ **Automated suite (20%):** Auth, Sync, AI endpoints covered

**Alignment Score:** 98%

**Minor Gap:**
- ⚠️ **Markdown conversion edge cases not tested:** Backend supports DOCX/PDF/HTML → Markdown, but test plan only includes "corrupted document" test. Should add specific conversion tests (e.g., "complex table in PDF", "embedded images in DOCX").

**Strength:**
- Top 5 priority scenarios directly test MVP success metrics (<5 min, 80% accuracy)
- 80/20 manual/auto split is pragmatic for MVP speed

---

### 8. Cross-Cutting Concerns ⚠️ **Some Gaps (85%)**

**Security:**

- ✅ Local-only storage (no external backend)
- ✅ HTTPS for local endpoints
- ✅ No data exfiltration risk

**Performance:**
- ✅ Dashboard <3s load (target defined)
- ✅ AI query <5s (target defined)
- ✅ Sync <5 min for 25 accounts (target defined)
- ⚠️ **Large data volume (500 accounts) not fully scoped:** Test plan mentions 15 min acceptable, but frontend IndexedDB quota management not specified. **Could hit browser storage limits.**

**Accessibility:**
- ✅ WCAG AA compliance
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Screen reader support
- ✅ Reduced motion support

**Alignment Score:** 85%

**Gap Found:**
- ⚠️ **IndexedDB quota management:** No strategy for handling storage quota exceeded errors. Should add graceful degradation (e.g., "Delete old data?" prompt, or selective sync).

---

---

## Gaps & Risks

### High Priority (Address Before v1 Launch)

#### Gap 1: Account Subset Selection Logic ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**
**Issue:** Frontend spec says "subset of accounts synced initially" but no criteria defined.

**Impact:**
- Backend doesn't know which accounts to prioritize
- Could sync wrong accounts first
- User confusion ("Why don't I see Account X?")

**Recommendation:**
- **Product Decision Required:** Define selection criteria
  - Option A: User selects accounts in Settings (manual control)
  - Option B: Sync "favorite" or "recently viewed" accounts first (intelligent)
  - Option C: Sync all accounts, paginate display (simple but slow)
- **Owner:** Product (Mara Focus) + Backend (Eko Logic)
- **Effort:** 1 day

---

#### Gap 2: Sync Progress Update Mechanism ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**
**Issue:** Frontend expects real-time sync progress, but backend mechanism undefined.

**Impact:**
- Frontend can't show accurate progress bar
- Poor UX during sync (user sees spinner, no feedback)
- Potential polling overhead if implemented poorly

**Recommendation:**
- **Technical Decision Required:** Choose update mechanism
  - Option A: **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** - Simple, one-way, perfect for progress
  - Option B: **WebSocket** - Bidirectional, more complex, overkill for progress
  - Option C: **HTTP Polling** - Simple but inefficient (poll every 2s)
- **Suggested:** Use SSE for sync progress (lightweight, real-time)
- **Owner:** Backend (Eko Logic) + Frontend (Cyrus Stack)
- **Effort:** 2 days

---

#### Gap 3: IndexedDB Quota Management ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**
**Issue:** No strategy for handling browser storage quota exceeded.

**Impact:**
- App breaks silently when quota hit (bad UX)
- Data loss if quota exceeded mid-sync
- Unpredictable behavior at scale (500+ accounts)

**Recommendation:**
- **Add Quota Monitoring:**
  ```javascript
  // Check available quota
  if (navigator.storage && navigator.storage.estimate) {
    const estimate = await navigator.storage.estimate();
    const percentUsed = (estimate.usage / estimate.quota) * 100;
    
    if (percentUsed > 80) {
      // Warn user, offer cleanup
      showToast('Storage almost full. Delete old data?');
    }
  }
  ```
- **Graceful Degradation:**
  - Prompt user to delete old accounts/documents
  - Offer selective sync (uncheck accounts)
  - Show storage usage in Settings
- **Owner:** Frontend (Cyrus Stack)
- **Effort:** 1 day

---

### Medium Priority (Monitor, Can Ship Without)

#### Gap 4: "New" Badge Visual Specification ⚠️ **LOW RISK**
**Issue:** Flow B mentions "New" badges on cards, but visual style undefined.

**Impact:** Inconsistent implementation, design iteration needed

**Recommendation:**
- Define badge style in Design System:
  - Color: Purple gradient (brand consistency)
  - Position: Top-right corner of card
  - Animation: Subtle pulse (2s duration, ease-in-out)
  - Dismissal: Auto-hide after 24h or user click
- **Owner:** Design System (Aria Patterns)
- **Effort:** 0.5 days

---

#### Gap 5: Markdown Conversion Edge Cases Not Tested ⚠️ **LOW RISK**
**Issue:** Backend supports complex conversions (PDF tables, DOCX images) but tests only cover "corrupted document."

**Impact:** Edge case bugs in production (tables render poorly, images missing)

**Recommendation:**
- Add conversion-specific tests:
  - Complex table in PDF → Markdown table
  - Embedded images in DOCX → Markdown image links
  - Nested lists in HTML → Markdown lists
  - Special characters (emoji, symbols) preservation
- **Owner:** QA (Kyra Gauge) + Backend (Eko Logic)
- **Effort:** 1 day

---

#### Gap 6: Chat Message Streaming Implementation ⚠️ **LOW RISK**
**Issue:** Design system specs "streaming text" but frontend architecture doesn't detail implementation.

**Impact:** AI responses appear all-at-once (no streaming effect), suboptimal UX

**Recommendation:**
- **Clarify Streaming Approach:**
  - Option A: Server-Sent Events (SSE) from backend
  - Option B: Simulate streaming client-side (chunk existing response)
- **Suggested:** Use SSE from LLM proxy for true streaming
- **Owner:** Frontend (Cyrus Stack) + Backend (Eko Logic)
- **Effort:** 1 day

---

### Low Priority (Defer to v2)

#### Enhancement 1: Deployment Topology Visualization
**Deferred from MVP:** Visual map of 400-500 sites  
**Reason:** Complex to implement, not critical for context understanding  
**v2 Value:** Helps with infrastructure discussions

#### Enhancement 2: Handoff Checklist Generator
**Deferred from MVP:** Automated transition checklist  
**Reason:** Manual workflow sufficient for MVP  
**v2 Value:** Reduces SE effort during handoffs

#### Enhancement 3: Context Timeline View
**Deferred from MVP:** Chronological project history  
**Reason:** Dashboard + AI queries cover need  
**v2 Value:** Better historical context visualization

#### Enhancement 4: Real-Time Sync
**Deferred from MVP:** Live updates instead of daily batch  
**Reason:** Adds complexity, daily sync acceptable  
**v2 Value:** More current data (hourly updates?)

#### Enhancement 5: Multi-User Collaboration
**Deferred from MVP:** Team sharing of insights  
**Reason:** Single SE focus for MVP  
**v2 Value:** Cross-team knowledge sharing

#### Enhancement 6: Advanced Analytics
**Deferred from MVP:** Trends, predictions, dashboards  
**Reason:** Descriptive analytics sufficient for MVP  
**v2 Value:** Proactive insights (churn risk, upsell triggers)

#### Enhancement 7: Mobile App
**Deferred from MVP:** Native iOS/Android apps  
**Reason:** PWA covers basic mobile use  
**v2 Value:** Better mobile UX, push notifications

#### Enhancement 8: Email Integration
**Deferred from MVP:** Sync email threads  
**Reason:** OneDrive + Salesforce cover core docs  
**v2 Value:** More complete customer communication history

## Technical Debt Assessment

### Current Debt: **LOW** ✅

**Architectural Decisions Limiting Future Options:**

1. **Local-First Architecture:**
   - **Trade-off:** Can't easily add cloud features (team dashboards, cross-SE insights)
   - **Mitigation:** PWA can be enhanced to sync with cloud in v2
   - **Debt Level:** LOW (intentional MVP constraint)

2. **Hash-Based Routing:**
   - **Trade-off:** Ugly URLs (`/#/dashboard` vs `/dashboard`)
   - **Mitigation:** Can migrate to browser routing later (PWA supports both)
   - **Debt Level:** LOW (UX cosmetic)

3. **In-Memory Document Transformation:**
   - **Trade-off:** No persistent transformation cache (re-convert on each sync)
   - **Mitigation:** Fast enough for 500 docs, can add cache later
   - **Debt Level:** LOW (performance acceptable)

4. **Primarily Manual Testing:**
   - **Trade-off:** Regression risk as features grow
   - **Mitigation:** Can incrementally add automation in v2
   - **Debt Level:** MEDIUM (invest in automation post-MVP)

**Recommendation:** Accept current debt levels. All trade-offs are intentional MVP choices that can be addressed in v2 without major refactoring.
