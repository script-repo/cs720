## Core Problem

Account transitions between Sales Engineers lose critical customer context because information is scattered across multiple systems, making handoffs manual, inconsistent, and risky.

---

## Why Now

- End-of-year territory realignments create multiple simultaneous transitions
- Personnel changes (departures/new hires) require rapid knowledge transfer
- Enterprise customer complexity at scale (400-500 sites) makes manual handoffs unsustainable
- Strategic executive conversations require comprehensive customer understanding

---

## Primary Users

- **Sales Engineers (SEs)** - Primary focus for account transitions and ongoing customer management

---

## Usage Context

- **End-of-year territory realignments** - Multiple accounts transition simultaneously
- **Personnel changes** - When SEs leave/join or accounts are reassigned
- **Remote/distributed teams** - Handoffs often happen asynchronously across time zones
- **Pre-customer meetings** - Need rapid context refresh before strategic conversations

---

## Pain Points

1. **No holistic customer view** - Information siloed across CRM, email, Slack, documentation tools, deployment systems
2. **Deployment topology invisible** - Technical infrastructure, configurations, and site details unclear or outdated
3. **Projects/initiatives buried** - Cannot quickly distinguish in-flight projects vs. planned initiatives vs. historical context
4. **Relational context missing** - Organizational hierarchy, key stakeholders, decision-makers, and meeting cadence not centrally documented
5. **Manual correlation errors** - Time-consuming and error-prone process of piecing together information from disparate systems

---

## Desired Outcomes

1. **Reduce customer analysis time from hours to minutes** - Fast ramp-up on account context
2. **Enable management of 400-500 sites across multiple enterprise customers** - Scale without losing detail
3. **Provide up-to-date information for quarterly business reviews** - Always-current customer intelligence
4. **Facilitate strategic executive-level conversations** - Comprehensive understanding enables higher-value interactions
5. **Eliminate manual data correlation errors between systems** - Single source of truth for customer context

## How Might We

**"How might we give SEs instant, comprehensive visibility into customer context so account transitions preserve institutional knowledge and maintain strategic momentum?"**

**Decision Log:**
- Focused on SEs as primary user (excluded Account Managers for MVP clarity)
- Identified scale requirement: 400-500 sites across enterprise customers
- Emphasized transition scenarios: year-end realignments and personnel changes
- Key metric: hours → minutes for customer context understanding
