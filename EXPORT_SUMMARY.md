10. **`CS720_CompletePackage.md`** (20 pages)
    - Look for artifact titled: "CS720 Complete Specification Package - Export"

**To save each artifact:**
- Click the artifact in the conversation
- Look for copy/download button (usually top-right of artifact viewer)
- Save as `.md` file with the filename above

### Method 2: Request Individual Exports

If you need any specific artifact as a standalone file, just ask:

**Example:** "Export the Frontend Architecture spec as a file"

I can recreate any of the 10 artifacts as a downloadable text file.

### Method 3: View in Browser

The artifacts are also visible in the conversation history. You can:
- Scroll through the conversation
- Read each artifact inline
- Copy sections as needed
